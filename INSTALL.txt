Install the Paint ruby gem:

  gem install paint

Create symbolic links (from this directory):

  sudo ln -s ./ag /usr/local/bin/ag
  sudo ln -s ./include /usr/local/lib/site_ruby

To enable BASH auto-completion, add this line to your ~/.bashrc:

  complete -C /usr/local/bin/ag -o default ag

Now re-launch your shell or source ~/.bashrc - and you should be done.

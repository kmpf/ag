INSTALLATION NOTES

Yeah, this is a bit embarassing. Right now, installation is a bit awkward. An installation package would be nice! But until that, try the following:

Install the Paint ruby gem:

  $ gem install paint
  -> you may have to make that a sudo gem install

Create symbolic links (from this directory):

  $ sudo ln -s ./ag /usr/local/bin/ag
  -> use any path you like as long as it's in your $PATH
  
  $ sudo ln -s ./include /usr/local/lib/site_ruby
  -> choose any path which is in Ruby's search path, try this: $ ruby -e 'puts $:'
  
To enable BASH auto-completion, add this line to your ~/.bashrc:

  complete -C /usr/local/bin/ag -o default ag
  -> Re-launch your shell or source ~/.bashrc
  
That should be it. Try 'ag help' to get started.
